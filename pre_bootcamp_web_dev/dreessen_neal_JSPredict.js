// Intro to JavaScript: Code Challenge: Predict Functions
// I am updating this file after reviewing the solution video
// I wasn't sure if I was to copy the code in or just the comment answers
// so adding in the code.
// also I got the first one wrong. I wasn't sure if you could concatenate
// a string and an integer.

function myBirthYearFunc(){
        console.log("I was born in " + 1980);
    }
    
// predict 1: 
// I was  born in 1980

// input is 1980
function myBirthYearFunc(birthYearInput){
        console.log("I was born in " + birthYearInput);
    }
    
// predict 2: 
// I was born in 1980

// num1 = 10, num2 = 20
function add(num1, num2){
        console.log("Summing Numbers!");
        console.log("num1 is: " + num1);
        console.log("num2 is: " + num2);
        var sum = num1 + num2;
        console.log(sum);
    }

// predict 3: 
// Summing Numbers!
// num1 is 10
// num2 is 20
// 30
